Title:
Little Wonders of Nature

Explanation:
Why are you making this project? What is your motivation?
- There are many small and beautiful surprises that the nature has given us. I feel the transition from the caterpillar into a beautiful butterfly is one of those.That has been the motivation behind this theme for this interactive learning experience.
 Kids should be taught about the wonders of nature first than the other materialistic things around us. I believe there is a lot to learn from nature and all the wonders that nature has given us are unconditional. Kids should be made aware of these things from an early age according to me.
Such interactive learning experiences will fun and help the kids learn more quickly. This is the reason I thought of making this project.


What are your inputs?
- My inputs for creating this interactive learning experience are through using p5.Js.
I have used interactions such as:
1. mouseX MouseY
2. mousePressed
3. buttons
4. hitzones
5. keyPressed

For the butterfly I have made an interaction where after the Spacebar is pressed, the butterfly follows the position on the mouse on the canvas.
Code Reference: https://p5js.org/examples/motion-moving-on-curves.html


What are your outputs?
- 1. mouseX mouseY has been designated to the caterpillar. The caterpillar moves according to the mouse.
2. Hitzones are the leaves that the caterpillar eats.
3. When the mouse is pressed on each leaf, the leaves will disappear respectively.
4. The button is for increasing the days when the caterpillar turns into a cocoon. It is a 14 days cycle by nature.
5. Then the butterfly will appear after the 14th day. Wherever you place the mouse on the canvas and press the spacebar, the butterfly will fly where the cursor is.


Who is the target audience for your project?
- The target audience for this project is kids in their nursery school. The purpose is to make them know the process of metamorphosis in a very simple way that they can will be able to understand.
This is an interactive learning where the kids will be able to learn more.


Where will your project be displayed?
- This project could be used in the nursery schools by the teachers. Kids should be asked to interact with it for them. This could also be displayed in homes by the kids' parents.
